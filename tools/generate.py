Regenerate every colour / background asset for the Prism Minimal rEFInd theme.

A "look" here is a **colour** x a **background**:

  * colour     — white (default) + green red pink blue
                 + premium iridescent obsidian-purple / champagne-gold
                 + premium gradient aurora / cyberpunk / platinum
                 — dark-background pieces
  * background — dark (black, default) or light (near-white)

Icons render white on the dark background (dark ink on the light one),
tinted toward the variant's own colour (ICON_TINT_MIX_SIMPLE / _PREMIUM) so
they read as the same palette as the selection graphic without becoming a
fully coloured icon. PREMIUM/GRADIENT get a much stronger tint than SIMPLE —
the selection ring already sells "premium" through full-saturation stroke +
hot core + halo + bloom, and a SIMPLE-strength wash on the icon next to that
just read as a plain pale colour, not the same finish. Every icon also bakes in a faint glass card: a barely-visible outline
plus an even fainter interior wash (see CARD_BORDER_ALPHA / CARD_FILL_ALPHA),
since rEFInd has no notion of an "unselected" graphic to draw it separately.
The OS row's card is a rounded square, the func_/tool_ row's a circle (see
SPECS) — otherwise identical treatment. The one focused entry also gets a
*partial light* traced on that exact same card perimeter (ring_geometry).
Only two opposite points ever light up — fixed at the upper-left and
lower-right, each a smoothstep bump in true distance along the card's own
edge (corner_bump) that fades to fully transparent well before the far
side, never a continuous ring. render_card_border already bakes a complete
faint neutral border into every icon (composited on top of this at the same
geometry), so this image adds only the coloured light — nothing in the dead
zones. Each lit point
layers a crisp hued core (blended toward white at its peak, for a "hot"
look), a softer wider halo, and a very restrained outer bloom — the halo/
bloom are just a Gaussian blur of the core's alpha, scaled down and capped
to the card's own margin so neither ever clips against the PNG edge. SIMPLE
colours show the same flat hue at both corners; PREMIUM and GRADIENT sample
their hue loop at the two anchor angles (phase-shifted per variant per
CYCLE_PHASE), so each corner picks up a different, related hue. On the light
background flat/iridescent/gradient hues are all darkened for contrast.

Every icon is also re-padded to a fixed content size so the row has consistent,
generous spacing regardless of how tightly each source icon was cropped.

There is no permanent, pre-generated `colors/` directory in this repository —
colour variants are build products, generated on demand (by install.sh, or by
hand) into a throwaway output directory.

# render fell from ~250/255 at 128px down to ~165/255 at 64px. The smaller
# master keeps the downscale ratio (64/50 = 1.28x) close to identity, so

# outline just outside the re-padded icon. `radius` is ~19% of each card's own
# outer half-width (size/2 - margin) — a soft, generous "app icon" rounding,
# not the tight corner a smaller radius reads as (unused for "small", a
# circle — see shape_sdf). All four measures scale with SCALE.
#
# rEFInd does NOT draw the selection backdrop at the icon's own size: it's
# scaled to (icon_size * 9/8) for the big row and (icon_size * 4/3) for the

# `OffsetX = (TotalWidth - CompWidth) >> 1`). The margin/radius/border below
# were tuned by eye as if backdrop and icon rendered at the same size — which
# is what this file's own preview wrongly assumed too (see TILE_RATIO's use
# in make_menu_preview), so it looked right there. On real hardware the
# backdrop is 12.5%/33% bigger than the icon it sits behind, so the card
# visibly floats outside the icon instead of hugging it. shrink_spec()
# pre-shrinks the card shape toward the canvas centre by 1/ratio so rEFInd's

# the whole boundary (reached at the two OTHER, unlit corners, where both
# distances are roughly a full edge-length), NOT by "half an edge away" --
# an earlier version of this comment got that wrong by ~2x and capped both
# shapes far more conservatively than the geometry actually allows. Measured
# numerically straight off ring_geometry's own boundary (see scratch check,
# 2026-09-13): ceiling frac is ~1.568 x outer for the rounded-square "big"
# card and ~1.414 x outer (== sqrt(2), the chord length between the two
# antipodal lit points at 90°) for the circular "small" one -- "small" isn't
# actually the one with more headroom, they're close; "big" has slightly
# more. Both get 80% of their own ceiling here, which leaves ~20% of the
# full perimeter genuinely dark (never a continuous ring) while making the
# lit majority the dominant read -- clearly past the midpoint of each edge,
# per the reference image the user pointed at ("currently reaches half a
# side; each one should be MORE than half"). Plateau is always HALF of its
# own half-width (not a sliver at the tip), so the lit stretch reads as a
# real block of solid colour that then fades, rather than a fade with a
# bright pinpoint.
#
# IMPORTANT: `outer` itself is already the POST-shrink_spec value (see
# SPECS/TILE_RATIO above) — these fractions apply to the smaller, hardware-
# correct card, not the original design size, so a frac increase here does
# NOT translate 1:1 into a longer arc measured against how an *old* build
# looked (outer itself moves too whenever SPECS changes) -- always recompute
# `half_width_frac * outer` in canvas px and compare that number, not the

#
# SIMPLE gets a modest mix — just enough to read as "a bit of colour," since

# stronger one: their selection ring already reads as unmistakably premium
# (full-saturation stroke, hot white core, halo, bloom, a different hue per
# icon via icon_tint's `name` phase), and at SIMPLE-strength dilution that
# same colour collapsed to a near-white smudge on the icon itself — no
# iridescence left to see. The higher mix keeps that per-icon hue clearly
